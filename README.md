# Learning Hydra for Machine Learning Projects  
This repository represents my first experience with Hydra, a powerful configuration management tool, in the context of machine learning.  

⚠️ **Note:** This is a learning-oriented project and not intended to be a fully developed or production-ready application.  

## Getting Started  

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use the following command to install Hydra and OmegaConf:  
   ```bash  
   pip install hydra-core omegaconf  
   ```  

2. **Run the Project**  
   Execute the main script with different environment configurations to explore Hydra's capabilities:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py --config-name <config_name>  
   ```  
   Replace `<config_name>` with the desired environment configuration.
   ## For this you must need to explore the config directories which config. you would prefer.
